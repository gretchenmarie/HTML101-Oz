                        <p>The Good Witch of the South is Glinda the Good. She is the most powerful of the Witches. According to the Soldier with Green Whiskers, Glinda:</p>

                        <p>So she was the most beautiful of the four witches. Later books in Baum's Oz series refer to Glinda as a Sorceress, rather than a Witch.</p>

                        <p>The Evil Witch of the East is most well known for her ruby slippers. We only see her legs and feet after Dorothy's house falls on her. </p>

Who would have thought a good little girl like you could destroy my beautiful wickedness?! ARRRRRGH! I'm gone! I'm gone! I'm going!... [is fully melted]"</blockquote>
